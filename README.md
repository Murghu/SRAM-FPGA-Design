# SRAM Implementation on FPGA

## Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a **Static Random Access Memory (SRAM)** using an **FPGA Spartan-6** board. The system is developed using **Verilog HDL** and synthesized using **Xilinx ISE**, ensuring efficient and reliable memory operations. The implementation aims to enhance **speed, reliability, and power efficiency** while optimizing FPGA resources.

## Key Features

- **2-bit SRAM implementation** using Verilog.
- **Read and Write operations** controlled via input switches.
- **Real-time memory state visualization** using LEDs.
- **UCF (User Constraint File) mapping** for FPGA pin allocation.
- **Efficient synthesis and simulation** using Xilinx ISE.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Initialization
- The SRAM module is initialized and mapped onto the **Spartan-6 FPGA**.
- Memory is structured as a **register-based storage unit**.
- Input and output signals are mapped using a **UCF file**.

### 2. Read/Write Operations
- **Write Operation:** Data is stored at a specific address when `write_enable` is HIGH.
- **Read Operation:** Stored data is retrieved when `write_enable` is LOW.
- **Memory Updates:** LED outputs display the stored values.

### 3. FPGA Pin Mapping (UCF Constraints)

The **UCF file** assigns specific FPGA pins for proper interfacing.
